# ðŸ§  Nephyra: Project Plan

## Vision
Nephyra aims to be a powerful CLI toolkit that intelligently inspects, explains, and recommends improvements for Linux systems â€” a devâ€™s personal system analyst and advisor with modular, extendable design.

---

## Core Modules

### Kernel Module
- Detect all installed kernel packages with deep filtering and smart reasoning  
- Suggest best-fit kernel per hardware, drivers (NVIDIA, audio), and init system  
- Awareness of real-time, hardened, LTS, Zen, and other kernel variants  
- Integration with bootloader config for safe switching

### Bootloader Awareness
- Detect bootloader type (GRUB, systemd-boot, rEFInd, etc.)  
- Parse config to identify default kernel and boot options  
- Support for modifying or suggesting improvements safely  

### Power & CPU Governor
- Detect CPU model, frequency scaling driver (intel_pstate, acpi_cpufreq, etc.)  
- Current CPU governor and options  
- Recommend power profiles (performance, balanced, powersave)  
- Integration with battery status on laptops  

### Package Mismatch and Updates
- Scan for mismatched or orphaned packages (especially kernel modules, drivers)  
- Suggest critical security updates or stability patches  
- Optionally integrate with distro-specific update tools (pacman, apt, dnf)

### UI Output
- Modular CLI output style: plain, colored, detailed, brief  
- Support language/localization variants (English + expansions)  
- Option for JSON/structured output for scripts or integration

---

## CLI Commands

- `nephyra check`: System health check, kernel, drivers, power status  
- `nephyra explain`: Explain detected issues or configurations in human-readable language  
- `nephyra "How's my setup?"`: Quick summary report for casual overview  
- (future) `nephyra fix`: Safe auto-fixes or guided recommendations

---

## Expansion Ideas

### LLM Plugin Integration
- Use LLM (like GPT) to provide contextual explanations or advanced diagnostics  
- Interactive Q&A for troubleshooting system issues

### Remote Sync and Export
- Sync system reports remotely for diagnostics or backup  
- Export reports as PDF/HTML or upload to cloud

### DE / WM Awareness
- Detect desktop environment (KDE Plasma, GNOME, XFCE, Hyprland, etc.)  
- Provide DE-specific recommendations or tweaks  
- Integrate with compositor configs or theme info

### Hardware and Driver Deep-Dive
- GPU detection with model, driver, Vulkan/OpenGL support  
- Network hardware and firmware versions  
- Storage device SMART status and health

---

## Notes

- Keep modules decoupled and optional for lightweight usage  
- Provide developer-friendly API for scripting and automation  
- Prioritize privacy: no data leaves the system without explicit user consent
