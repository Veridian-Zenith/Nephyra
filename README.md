# Nephyra (Beta/Test)

Currently, the following commands are functional:

- `cargo run - kernel`
- `cargo run - hardware`


Nephyra is your terminal-based, smart system insight assistant.
Ask her things like:

\`\`\`
> Nephyra "System Setup"
\`\`\`

And sheâ€™ll tell you everything you didnâ€™t know you needed.

## ðŸ”§ Goals
- Cross-check active vs installed kernels
- Detect mismatched headers/modules
- Report system performance, boot mode, DE/WM info
- Natural-language input/output
